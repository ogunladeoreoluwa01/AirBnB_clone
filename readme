# Using Branches and Pull Requests on GitHub

To effectively manage your project and collaborate with your team members on GitHub, follow these steps to use branches and pull requests:

## 1. Create a New Branch:

Use the following command to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on:

```bash
git checkout -b feature_branch_name
```

Replace `feature_branch_name` with an appropriate name for your branch, indicating the feature or bug fix you're implementing.

## 2. Make Changes:

Make changes to your code on the new branch. You can add new features, fix bugs, or make improvements to existing code.

## 3. Push Branch to GitHub:

Once you're done making changes, push the branch to your GitHub repository to share your changes with your team members:

```bash
git push origin feature_branch_name
```

This command pushes the new branch `feature_branch_name` to your GitHub repository.

## 4. Create a Pull Request:

Go to your GitHub repository's page and navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab. Then, follow these steps:

- Click on the "New pull request" button.
- Select the base branch (usually `main` or `master`) and the branch containing your changes (`feature_branch_name`).
- Review the changes and add a description if necessary.
- Click on the "Create pull request" button to create the pull request.

## 5. Collaborate and Review:

Collaborate with your team members to review and approve the pull request. Discuss any changes, improvements, or concerns related to the code changes.
Once approved, merge the pull request into the base branch (`main` or `master`) to incorporate your changes into the main codebase.

By using branches and pull requests, you can keep your main codebase clean and organized, collaborate effectively with your team members, and easily track changes and contributions to the project.

# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

## Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This command-line interpreter is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This project is essential as it sets the foundation for all subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

### Project Goals
- Implement a parent class (BaseModel) to handle initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- Create a flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.
- Define classes for AirBnB objects (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from BaseModel.
- Develop the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python script (`console.py`) built using the `cmd` module. It provides a shell for managing AirBnB objects, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `console.py` script using Python:

#python3 console.py

### Usage
Once the command interpreter is started, you'll see the prompt `(hbnb)`. Here are some basic commands you can use:

- `help`: Display help information about available commands.
- `create <class_name>`: Create a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <class_name> <object_id>`: Display details of a specific instance.
- `all <class_name>`: Display details of all instances of a specific class.
- `update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>`: Update an attribute of a specific instance.
- `destroy <class_name> <object_id>`: Delete a specific instance.

### Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:
