                            /deck to relax and have a glass of Merlot.

                                        <p>Fantastic place! It was clean, Adrienne was great even though we didn't get to
                                            meet her in person and everything went super smooth. Location is alsos great if you like running
                                            or something a bit quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you would have
                                            to uber into the city from the location. Overall, I would recommend this place anytime.
